              'Mahjoor\'s real name was Ghulam Ahmad. But as a poet, he adopted the pen name \'Mahjoor\'. He was born in eighteen hundred and eighty-five in Metragam. He has written poetry in Persian and Urdu as well. Mahjoor worked in Kashmir as a patwari. Along with his official duties, he used to write poetry in Kashmiri. Mahjoor had his first Kashmiri poem published in 1918. After this, he composed poetry only in Kashmiri. His songs became very popular. He wrote on such topics as love, communal harmony, and social reform, and also wrote on the plight of the Kashmiris. He wrote about youth, the flowers of Nishat Garden, a peasant girl, a gardener, the golden oriole, and a Free Kashmir. At that time, such songs were unknown in Kashmiri poetry. It was Mahjoor who gave these to us. Mahjoor was sixty-seven years old when he passed away in 1952. The death of Mahjoor was a great loss to both the Kashmiri language and (Kashmiri) poetry. But, Mahjoor\'s songs are still on the lips of every Kashmiri. Through these songs, his name will live forever. '),

              'Soch Kral was born in 1775 at Koel, Pulwama, Kashmir. Soch Kral was from a mystic background. His father Arif Kral was a disciple of Kashmiri poet Mumin Sahib. His mother\'s name was Zooni. His parents were very pious and noble It’s said that Arif Kral and his wife Zooni had no child. After fifteen years of their marriage, a fanafillah arrived in the village saying “Does anyone need a child?”. Arif Kral listening to this left his work and went to him. The mystic gave him two sugar-coated candies one for Arif Kral and another for his wife, Zooni, on the condition that the child will be given back to him after twelve years. The parents agreed on this condition. A male baby was born to them whom they named Ismail. After some years the Fana fillah arrived in the village and asked Ismail his name. He suggested Arif Kral name Ismail as Soch Kral. It is said that this mystic after twelve years as per the condition took Soch Kral from Koel to Inder Pulwama. Thus began the mystic journey of the great son of the soil. Soch Kral was too much interested in poetry. His father Arif Kral sent him to school but Soch Kral showed no apparent interest to attend the school or his classes. So his father Arif Kral insisted he help him in his generations-old potter profession. In this way, Soch Kral began to sell terracotta pots. The terracotta industry taught him valuable lessons. Soch Kral had never been in school but he had a good hold in the Persian language. He spoke the language of the common people and used poetry as a too tool to pass his message of truth to the people. A number of miracles are attributed to Sufi poet Soch Kral. It’s said that Some people in the Ratnipora vicinity were unhappy to see the huge rush of people flocking to Soch Kral for spiritual healing. They started a hate campaign against Soch Kral sb. A number of tricks were used to defame this great mystic poet but Soch Kral remained silent. Once more than a hundred people assembled by these people to have lunch and tea at Soch Kral’s residence without informing Soch Kral sb. His wife was shocked. She was only to be assured by Soch Kral that everything will be fine. The tea vessel never got empty despite people having four-five cups of salt tea. Similarly, lunch was served to those in the house, making them understand the mystic powers of Soch Kral. After some time another Karamat happened when Soch Kral was in Ratinpora to sell his earthen pots. He saw a group of people dragging a dead Bull from the area and when he asked them the reason, they laughed and replied, “Don’t interfere in our matter. This Bull has the credit of his master and he died without returning his master’s credit”. Soch Kral looked towards the Bull and said,\'O Bull get up by the order of Allah and return the credit of your master\'. The entire Ratnipora was astonished to see the bull coming to life again and rushing toward his master. This Karamat didn’t go well with the Peers who thrashed him on the next day of this incident. It’s believed at this moment, Soch Kral prayed: “Ya Allah Chararas (Chrar-i Shareef) Kar Thhop Tae Ratinporis Hya Tchoup” (block the Charar-i Shareef and bite the Ratinpora). Legend has it that there was a massive fire in the Charar-e-Shareef area in Budgam which got extinguished immediately after the prayers one log flew and fell into a house of a Peer at Ratinpora and all the houses of Peers were gutted in the fire. After this incident, Peers apologized to Soch Kral.'),

Malik married a woman named Gasha from the same village. They had one daughter and three sons. He worked as a laborer, milkman, and imam. He sang Sufi poetry and himself authored numerous poems in the Kashmiri language; two books of his poetry have been published, including Kuliyati Lala Aragami (2008). As a Sufi teacher, he attracted followers from across the Kashmir Valley. Malik died on 27 August 1988.

            'Victoria Schofield describes the book as an expansion of Lamb\'s earlier work with the use of newly available documents. Schofield states that Lamb successfully identified the main issues and mistakes. Schofield finds that Lamb\'s work is so filled with facts that additional notes are provided with each chapter. Lamb also successfully shows the impact a few individuals have had on South Asia\'s history. Ross H. Munro observes that Lamb has written an authoritative history of Kashmir. He called Lamb\'s work a "tour de force" that "combines impeccable scholarship with a fascinating story". Munro sees that Lamb refutes India\'s claim on Kashmir and seriously indicts Indian actions, leaders, and also his own countryman, Mountbatten. Victor Kiernan recommends the book. Kiernan notes that Lamb is the top authority on the region and describes the book, like Lamb\'s previous ones, as very thorough, uninvolved, and objective, regardless of the rare instance where India is treated with "little sympathy." Historian Hugh Tinker notices that Alastair Lamb explains Kashmiri political history in a "masterly style." Tinker points out that Lamb is known as the foremost authority on the region but also notes that his findings will not be accepted by Indian authors, who see Kashmir as a test of Indian secularism. Copland observes that Lamb\'s analysis of the Kashmir conflict is the most detailed and describes his work as a "considerable feat of scholarship." Copland states that the problems in the book are "few and far between" and notes that this high caliber book\'s bibliography ignores post-1980 writings. Parshotam Mehra, on the other hand, points out that Lamb is unabashedly pro-Pakistan with several bones to pick against India, arguing for various ways in which Kashmir could have gone to Pakistan instead of India. He also points out how Lamb glosses over the culpability of Pakistan in the 1947 crisis as well as in later developments, facts which scholars such as Ayesha Jalal admit. Mehra concludes: That Islamabad has a case of sorts that would be hard to deny, but that New Delhi has none may be difficult to accept. The path of reason, which this study sadly spurns, is to map out the common ground...',
