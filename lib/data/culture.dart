The term Wazwan is derived from two words, ‘waz’ meaning cook or cooking and ‘wan’ meaning shop in Kashmiri language. Some of the items are cooked overnight with great precision. This multi-course dish is usually prepared during special occasions of the Kashmiris like the marriage ceremony. The art of preparing the Wazwan, which is considered with pride, has been passed on hereditarily and is hardly shared to anyone outside blood relations. Thus some wazas have made their names with their rich lineage of such service and remains greatly in demand during occasions.\nWazwan is served in traem or a large copper platter with each platter serving a group of four guests. While the name of Allah is taken by the Kashmiri Muslims prior to consuming the meal, the Kashmiri Brahmins take the name of Lord Rudra. The ritual of Tash-t-naer that is washing of hands of the guests takes place with the attendants taking around a jug and a basin. The traem heaped with rice that is quartered with four sheek kababs also including two tabak maaz, barbecued lamb ribs prepared with milk, butter and ground spices; four methi kormas, prepared out of chicken or mutton seasoned with combination of spices including dried methi (fenugreek) leaves; one zafran kokur, a preparation of chicken with saffron sauce; one safed kokur, a preparation of chicken with white sauce; and a few other courses is served to the guests. Accompaniments of the meal which are served in small earthen pots include chutneys or dips and saffron garnished yogurt. Thereafter the junior cook or the waza serves around twenty more courses.',

Once the couple’s families have come to an agreement an engagement is announced. The groom’s family often gives jewelry to the bride and sometimes rings and flowers are exchanged as well. The groom’s parents traditionally buy the bridal trousseau for the Kashmiri bride, complete with clothes and jewellery to be worn on the wedding day.\nThe commencement of the wedding celebrations will be the henna or ‘mehendi’ sent to the bride’s home from the groom’s family. The girls apply mehendi on the bride\'s hands and feet. She then puts on all her bridal jewelry and vividly coloured and sequined sari or lehenga.\nThe nikah or marriage contract may have been completed earlier or at the time just before the main wedding day and the bride’s ‘mehr’ or dowry is decided upon.\nOn the main wedding day the groom is taken to the bride’s house in a procession called the ‘baraat’ he is wearing a ‘sherwani kurta’ with ‘churidar pyjama’ topped off with a special turban.\nTraditionally, the bride will wear a heavily decorated red or bright coloured ‘lehenga’ and a dupatta over her head. The over garment is embroidered in gold and complemented with lots of gold jewelry.\nThe ladies in the family sing traditional wedding songs and the groom is showered with coins, sweets and almonds and he is presented with a garland.\nWeddings in Kashmir are always accompanied by amazing feasts, of multiple dishes, called ‘vazvan’ food -prepared by special chefs. It will be cooked in huge cauldrons with many dishes of mutton, chicken and varieties of biryani. It is preferable that you arrive hungry and not be a vegetarian!!\nThe wedding celebration will be held in one or two huge tents erected near the bride’s home these will accommodate hundreds of guests, as all the community are invited. Men and women eat separately. The close relatives of the groom can enter where the bride is seated to give her gifts. Often there are special wedding performers called ‘hijra’ who dance and sing traditional songs - these men are dressed in sequined gowns.\nThe bride will get ready to leave with her new husband when the groom asks permission to take her to his home. The women will sing and drum and there will be tears shed as she departs for her new life. At her new home she is greeted by her mother-in-law who symbolically lifts her veil in recognition of her new status as a married woman and presents her with a piece of jewelry.\nThe following day the groom’s family hold a feast called the ‘walima’ day where they invite their family, friends and people from their community.\nOn the fourth day the bride’s family invite the groom’s family for dinner and then finally on the seventh day the groom’s family invites the bride’s family for dinner and then she is allowed to come and stay with her own family for a few days.
