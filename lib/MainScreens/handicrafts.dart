He brought along with him 700 artisans from Iran. These artisans are thought to have taught the local Kashmiris various art forms; and paper mache craft was one of them.No matter what the story of its origin, this art was made highly popular during the Mughal rule. The art was originally known by its Iranian name Kar-i-Qalamdani in Kashmir. The word ‘Qalamdani’ is basically pen case.

This art has also traditionally existed as a family profession in Kashmir. And like many other Kashmiri handicrafts, the trick and technique behind it gets passed on from one generation to another.Even though the idea behind this handicraft might sound relatively simple, it is a very time-consuming process and requires a lot of precision. It basically involves two main steps- Sakthsazi (making of the actual item) and Naqashi (the painting and decoration part).Now, let’s take a look at the making of paper mache handicrafts in detail.',

Then, a mixture of the soaked waste paper, cloth and the straw of a rice plant is pounded manually in a stone mortar. This is pounded until the mixture becomes very fine and forms a pulp. Then, a rice based glue called ‘Atij’ is combined with this pulp mixture.This complete mixture is then applied onto the desired mould and then left to dry for a few days. After it has dried out, the artwork is very carefully separated from the mould. The artwork is basically cut in two halves to separate it from the mould and the halves are carefully joined with the help of glue. The resultant object that is obtained is known as ‘Kalib’. Then, for the next step, the kalib is handed over to the women. This process is referred to as ‘Pishlawun’. As the next step, the women smoothen out the surface of the artwork with either a stone, baked clay or a wooden file.After the object is nicely smoothened out, it is coated with a light layer of paint/ lacquer. It is coated again with a second coat of lacquer mixed with some chalk powder and water. This is again left to dry out for some time.After the sakthsazi’s work is done, the artwork/ object is handed over to the Naqash.',

The butter paper is pasted so that it acts as a barrier between the main object and the paintwork so that the object doesn’t crack. After covering with butter paper, a thin coat of paint is applied all over the artwork. This is actually the step where the object is transformed into the beautiful piece of paper mache handicraft that we know. This work is also very intricate and usually takes about 3 days to a week. The designs are first drawn free hand on the object and then they are painted. The designer uses various different motifs like flowers, fruits, birds, creepers etc.Mostly metallic paints are used for an illuminated effect. After the motifs are painted, often gold or silver is used to highlight them. Mostly the colors that are used for painting are all organic and either nature or vegetable-based. When the whole painting procedure is completed, the final step involves covering the artwork with a layer of varnish for an added shine.This is the whole procedure that goes into making paper mache crafts. It is an extensive process that requires a lot of patience and attention to detail. But, the whole process is worth it as the end result is absolutely stunning.Even though these handicrafts are made using paper, the extensive process that goes into making them is what makes these handicrafts extremely durable. Each of these individually created items has a unique story to tell. The Kashmir paper mache crafts are largely pursued by the Shia sect of the Kashmiri Muslims.',

Their intricate designs, quality of wool, and skilled craftsmanship made them treasured possessions among the nobility and affluent traders in Europe and Central Asia. \n Over the years, the art of making Kashmiri shawls evolved, incorporating various influences and design motifs, including floral patterns, paisleys, and intricate geometric designs.

Meanwhile, his assistants prepare the white and blue inks, by mixing sand from the river of Jhelum with some kerosene. The trace paper is placed carefully on the cloth and a paper weight placed over it. It is then that a duster dipped in ink (blue for dark shaded cloth and white for light shaded ones) is passed. The result causes prints of chinar leaves, paisleys and different types of Kashmiri flowers to befall these pieces of plain cloth. This, “Chaamp Traavun” is the second step in casting the beautiful embroidery.This imprinted cloth is then passed onto a Tilla artisan who uses two threads – one of staple and the other of Tilla and embroiders the plain canvas awaiting his strokes. The technique involves threading the Tilla over the fabric using a specialized needle and fastening this embellishment with a camouflaging cotton thread for a perfect and long lasting finesse. The thread of Tilla is altogether a new dimension, where malleable copper is used as an underwire and coated with silver or gold hues to achieve the desired thickness for the embroidery to be done. The Tilla threads hence obtained are of varying types – the Angora, Hiran, Murga and Peacock. Of these, the most commonly used thread is of the Hiran for it does not age, its sheen remaining unaffected across the folds of time. Once embroidered, the apparel or accessories are sent for washing and ironing for the finished piece to reflect elegance. Special care is taken that a hot iron does not come in direct contact with the Tilla, lest its sheen gets damaged by the heat.',
